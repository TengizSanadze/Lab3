PHYTHON:

In Python a function is defined using the def keyword. 
To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis. 
Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. 
I can add as many arguments as I want, just separate them with a comma.



JAVA:

1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. 
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before.
Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
