PHYTHON:

In Python a function is defined using the def keyword. 
To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis. 
Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. 
I can add as many arguments as I want, just separate them with a comma.
