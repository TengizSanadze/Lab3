1)  Calculator Phython

In this program, I ask the user to choose an operation. Options 1, 2, 3 and 4 are valid. If any other input is given, Invalid Input is displayed and the loop continues until a valid option is selected.

Two numbers are taken and an if...elif...else branching is used to execute a particular section. User-defined functions add(), subtract(), multiply() and divide() evaluate respective operations and display the output.



2)  Insetion sort in Java

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
Algorithm:
To sort an array of size n in ascending order:
1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.


Reflection:

This was my first time using Python. Expectation was high and I really enjoyed using new language.
As I see all these languages are  70% similar which makes life really enjoyable :) 

I learned that he biggest difference between the two languages is that Java is a statically typed and Python is a dynamically typed. Python is strongly but dynamically typed. This means names in code are bound to strongly typed objects at runtime.
